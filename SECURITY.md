# Security Guide for PingOne User Management Application

## ðŸ”´ Critical Security Issues

### 1. Known Vulnerabilities
- **jsrsasign dependency**: High severity vulnerability (Marvin Attack of RSA and RSAOAEP decryption)
  - **Status**: Known issue in @ping-identity/p14c-js-sdk-auth dependency
  - **Impact**: Potential cryptographic vulnerabilities
  - **Mitigation**: Monitor for updates from PingIdentity, consider alternative libraries

### 2. Credential Management
- **Current State**: âœ… Secure - Uses localStorage with proper encryption
- **Best Practice**: Consider using secure session storage for sensitive data
- **Recommendation**: Implement server-side session management for production

### 3. File Upload Security
- **Current State**: âœ… Secure - Uses multer with destination validation
- **Best Practice**: File type validation and size limits implemented
- **Recommendation**: Add virus scanning for production environments

## ðŸŸ¡ Security Recommendations

### 1. Environment Variables
```bash
# Create .env file for sensitive configuration
PINGONE_ENV_ID=your_environment_id
PINGONE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PINGONE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

### 2. HTTPS in Production
- Always use HTTPS in production environments
- Configure proper SSL/TLS certificates
- Enable HSTS headers

### 3. Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated on both client and server side
- CSV parsing includes validation for required fields
- File uploads are restricted to specific types

### 4. Error Handling
- Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages
- Proper logging without exposing credentials
- Graceful error handling for API failures

## ðŸŸ¢ Security Features

### 1. Authentication
- OAuth 2.0/OIDC implementation
- Secure token storage
- Automatic token refresh

### 2. Authorization
- Scope-based access control
- Environment-specific permissions
- User role validation

### 3. Data Protection
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Secure credential storage in browser
- Encrypted communication with PingOne APIs

## ðŸ”§ Security Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Dependency Updates**: Run `npm audit` weekly
2. **Security Scans**: Use `npm run security` to check for vulnerabilities
3. **Credential Rotation**: Regularly rotate PingOne credentials
4. **Log Review**: Monitor import-status.log for suspicious activity

### Incident Response
1. **Credential Compromise**: Immediately rotate PingOne credentials
2. **Vulnerability Discovery**: Update dependencies and test thoroughly
3. **Data Breach**: Follow organization's incident response procedures
